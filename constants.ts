  aboutMe: "Silvia (b 1999) is a London-based fine art photographer whose work interrogates the fluid boundaries between the tangible and the perceived. A graduate of Central Saint Martins, she has pivoted from the structural rigour of fashion towards a more ephemeral exploration of the 'shifted concept' — capturing the weight of a glance within a fleeting moment.\n\nHer practice is deeply rooted in travel and the quiet observation of nature and still life. By isolating objects from their traditional contexts, Silvia creates unreal spaces where philosophical enquiry and visual subtlety converge. For her, the camera is not a tool for documentation, but a medium for leaping between states of being.",

      description: `Twice is a series of diptych film photographs exploring the fragility of memory and the quiet dissonances embedded in everyday life.

Heraclitus observed that no one steps into the same river twice — not because the river changes, but because both the river and the person are always becoming something else. Memory operates similarly. We return to it expecting repetition and find instead a thing subtly altered, a detail misplaced, a feeling that no longer quite fits the image it belongs to.

Each photograph in this series pairs two frames that appear, at first glance, identical. They are not. The differences between them — sometimes stark, sometimes barely perceptible — enact the unreliability of recollection itself. Within individual images, too, there are misfits: objects and moments that resist the coherence of the scenes they inhabit, held in place by some invisible thread rather than any clear logic.

Shot on film, the series embraces the medium's own relationship with time and imperfection — its grain, its slight unpredictability — as formal extensions of the theme. Memory, like film, is a chemical process. It changes with exposure.`,
