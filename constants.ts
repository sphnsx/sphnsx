  aboutMe: "Silvia (b 1999) is a London-based fine art photographer whose work interrogates the fluid boundaries between the tangible and the perceived. A graduate of Central Saint Martins, she has pivoted from the structural rigour of fashion towards a more ephemeral exploration of the 'shifted concept' — capturing the weight of a glance within a fleeting moment.\n\nHer practice is deeply rooted in travel and the quiet observation of nature and still life. By isolating objects from their traditional contexts, Silvia creates unreal spaces where philosophical enquiry and visual subtlety converge. For her, the camera is not a tool for documentation, but a medium for leaping between states of being.",

      title: 'HUSH HUSH',
      description: "HUSH HUSH was photographed in Humlebæk, Denmark, during the long light of a Northern European summer. The series observes quiet fragments of an ordinary afternoon — wild flowers in a field, reflections in open windows, a distant boat, a house half-hidden by trees.\n\nIn this region, when the sun finally arrives, everyone steps outside. Parks and seafronts fill with people, yet in these photographs the crowd is barely visible. Shot through a 90mm lens, each frame isolates a scene or object, keeping distance while moving closer. The images appear serene, though they are surrounded by life and sound.",
